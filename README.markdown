* [PirateBox](http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox) by _David Darts_ is both useful and damn fine looking.

* _pspunderground_ has [sorta] [ported it to android](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=935157) (based on _Jochen Ruehl's_ [PAW](http://paw-android.fun2code.de/) beanshell-powered web server).

* **SteamBox** is a theme for that project.

### To install:

* [Download SteamBox](https://github.com/thedod/SteamBox/archives/master) (or clone/fork it).
* Install [pspunderground's apk](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=935157).
* rename `/sdcard/paw/html` (to keep it as a backup) and use the `html` folder from SteamBox instead.

Easy

The main [changes](https://github.com/thedod/SteamBox/commit/32e3c4ed99b49748fa19b07f52309f2606c0fd45) are in html/css: I kinda envy those shiny black lunchboxes, but it
would be daft to build one for my personal phone, so at least I can give it a [relatively]
spiffy html look and feel like an "armchair maker" ;).

PAW is easy to tinker with and has good droid integration. So far - I've added a single feature: 
you get a notification when a file is uploaded.

I might add chat (maybe not exactly like the lunchbox version), text-to-speech shoutouts, and other schticks later on.

It's a fun project
