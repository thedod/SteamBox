* [PirateBox](http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox) by _David Darts_ is both useful and damn fine looking.

* _pspunderground_ has [sorta] [ported it to android](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=935157) (based on _Jochen Ruehl's_ [PAW](http://paw-android.fun2code.de/) beanshell-powered web server).

* **SteamBox** is a theme for that project.

### To install:

* [Download SteamBox](https://github.com/thedod/SteamBox/archives/master) (or clone/fork it).
* Install [pspunderground's apk](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=935157).
* rename `/sdcard/paw/html` (to keep it as a backup) and use the `html` folder from SteamBox instead.

### Features:

* Original Android PirateBox functionality: upload/browse/download
* Shoutbox (not a chat, but fun): 1-line history + text-to-speach
* Upload notification to Android (discards old notifications to avoid clutter)
* [Relatively] spiffy design :)

Enjoy it. Fork it. It's fun.
